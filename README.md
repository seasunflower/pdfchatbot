## How to Activate the Virtual Environment
Open Command Prompt or your preferred terminal.

Navigate to your project directory (where env is located) by running:

```
 cd path\to\your\project
```

Activate the environment by running:

```
env\Scripts\activate 
```

Once activated, you will see (env) at the beginning of the command prompt line, indicating that the environment is active.

## How to Deactivate the Virtual Environment
Deactivate the environment at any time by running:

```
deactivate
```
After deactivation, the (env) prefix will disappear, returning you to the global Python environment.
